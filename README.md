# spectracl
Model based classification of MALDI-TOF spectra.


# Method
* standarise and make spectra comparable with:
    * square root transformation
    * smoothing
    * baseline removal
    * normalisation/calibration
    * taking mean of bins with width 1
* perform classification with model


# Items to investigate
* method to summarise spectra for comparison
    - sliding window may be better
